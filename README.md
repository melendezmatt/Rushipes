## Summary

Rushipes is an application inspired by my passion for the culinary arts. The main purpose of the app is to be able to find recipes based on the ingredients you currently have in your pantry so you have some inspiration for what to cook when you don't know what you're in the mood for. Secondly, you have the ability to create recipes yourself and can input servings, cook time, prep time, and the instructions necessary to cook your food. The front end of this application was made with React and it follows Redux architecture. The backend was developed using Flask and PostgresSQL. The APIs are designed around REST principles. The final touch and design was also created using raw CSS.
